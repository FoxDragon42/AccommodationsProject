# AccommodationsProject

This repository serves as the public host for my accommodations project. This project was made using Articulate Storyline 3. I make no claims to the software used to make the project, but the graphics and ideas expressed in the project are my own, except when noted otherwise.

Thanks to github.com/SamPlaysKeys for his contributions as a material expert.
A huge thanks to the Iris Center for creating much of the instructional content on which this project was based. Their content has been used for this project with express permission and consent, and they have been involved in many stages of creation.

Finally, thank you so much to all the people who have assisted in creating proofreading, testing, and making suggestions along the way. I couldn't have done it without your help!
